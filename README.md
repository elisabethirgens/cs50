# CS50

This repo is to track progress, and gather notes from [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/).

[ide.cs50.io](https://ide.cs50.io/) is fantastic for getting started with CS50, but I wanted to have some of my code in this repo, and to run these projects in my local terminal. Here's an approach to that:

## Run locally

- Install [cs50/libcs50](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50)
- Compile with for example `gcc -lcs50 -o recursion recursion.c`
- Run program `./recursion`
